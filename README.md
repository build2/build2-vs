# build2-vs
Visual Studio extension to integrate the build2 toolchain

This project aims to add Visual Studio IDE integration for various tasks and workflows related to developing with the build2 toolchain.
The goal is to make life easier for developers used to Visual Studio, whilst also making build2 more accessible to those who may have so far been put off trying it by the lack of IDE integration.
